        <p><strong>Welcome to my portfolio!</strong> My name is Ian Gregg and I'm a native Oregonian born and raised. I have had a large background in sales but now changing my career path to become a developer. Most of my time outside of work consists of working in the garden, hiking, and enjoying life with friends and family. I recently finished up a certification in JavaScript and found that I have <em>nack</em> for coding which sent me down the path of studying it full time at Epicodus. I love the color <span style="color:green">Green</span>.</p>
